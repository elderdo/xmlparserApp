The profile script for a C Shell (`csh` or `tcsh`) account is typically named `.cshrc`. This script is executed whenever a new C Shell session starts, and it contains various configurations and environment variables.

### Common C Shell Profile Scripts:
1. **`.cshrc`**: Contains user-specific configurations and environment variables.
2. **`.login`**: Executed during login shells, after `.cshrc`.

### Example of a `.cshrc` File:
```csh
# Set environment variables
setenv ORACLE_HOME /path/to/oracle
setenv PATH $ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH

# Alias definitions
alias ll 'ls -l'
alias h 'history'

# Other configurations
set prompt = "%n@%m:%~> "
```

### Example of a `.login` File:
```csh
# Source .cshrc to ensure settings are loaded
source ~/.cshrc

# Additional login-specific settings
echo "Welcome to your C Shell account!"
```

### Location:
These files are usually located in the user's home directory:
```csh
~/.cshrc
~/.login
```

### Viewing or Editing:
To view or edit the `.cshrc` file, you can use a text editor like `vi`, `nano`, or `emacs`:
```csh
vi ~/.cshrc
```
